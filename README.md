# Akash Deploy UI

This is a super alpha version of a deploy UI for Akash. I've thrown this together in a few evenings but rather than polish it, I want to release it as soon as possible so people can start using Akash even if they aren't as comfortable with the command line.

I'll actually publish the docker images and update this README with screenshots and docs tomorrow. If anyone finds this repo in the meantime, docker-compose will get you the rest of the way if you want to explore..
